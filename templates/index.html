    <h2>Welcome to the Blood Donation Management System</h2>
    <p>
        Blood donation is a vital act of compassion that saves millions of lives every year. It not only helps accident victims and surgical patients but also supports those battling life-threatening conditions like cancer and anemia. One pint of blood can save up to three lives, making every donor a silent hero. Blood cannot be manufacturedâ€”it can only come from generous donors like you. Regular donations ensure that blood banks are always stocked for emergencies, giving hope to those in need. By donating blood, you contribute to a healthier, more resilient community. Become a donor today and make a difference!
